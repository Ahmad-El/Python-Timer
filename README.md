# Timer

A Python-based timer application with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, PyQt6 for the graphical user interface, and additional features for enhanced time tracking.

## Overview

The Timer project is a versatile timer application that leverages Python, OOP concepts, and PyQt6 to provide a user-friendly interface for time tracking. It goes beyond a basic timer, allowing users to set specific time intervals, displaying total elapsed time since the app started, and providing an audible signal upon timer completion.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: The programming language used for application logic, object-oriented design, and backend functionality.
- **PyQt6**: A set of Python bindings for Qt libraries, employed for creating an interactive and visually appealing user interface.
- **MediaPlayer**: PyQt6's `QMediaPlayer` is utilized to play an audible signal upon timer completion.

## Features

- **Time Display**: The Timer application prominently displays the elapsed time, making it easy for users to track.
- **Customizable Timer**: Users can set specific time intervals for the timer, enhancing flexibility.
- **Total Elapsed Time**: The application shows the total time elapsed since the app started, offering a comprehensive time-tracking feature.
- **Audible Signal**: Upon reaching the end of the timer, a signal is triggered using PyQt6's `QMediaPlayer`.
- **Custom UI Design**: The user interface is thoughtfully designed for a seamless and visually pleasing experience.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python modules using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
